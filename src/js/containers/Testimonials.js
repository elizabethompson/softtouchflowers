            <p>I never dreamed the cross you designed for Sarah’s wedding would be so stunning. I still have people ask me who created the flowers for the Cross at Bella Collina for her and Daniel’s wedding. Great job, Diana!</p>

            <p>Soft Touch Flowers provided us with truly outstanding service for both our wedding and reception flowers. We originally chose Soft Touch Flowers because of Diana’s warm personality, excellent professionalism, and strong knowledge of and experience with floral arrangements. As we worked with Diana, we discovered how much more she had to offer us. She pays great attention to detail, and this shows in her work. She is very patient and listens carefully to your described style, likes and dislikes to ensure that she delivers the absolute perfect product. I was definitely impressed by Diana’s ability to take my rambling description of what I wanted for my wedding and produce floral masterpieces. I highly recommend Soft Touch Flowers!</p>
